Conveyor Belts
Who needs rails anyway?
<&conveyor_recipes>Conveyor Belts are an easy way of transporting all sorts of things around your base. While they are strong enough to move living creatures like cows or sheep, their true strength lies in transporting items.
Throwing items atop them will have the items move along the belt. Should the belt lead into an inventory, the item will be inserted.
Blocks like hoppers will be able to drop items onto the belts (rightclick) or adjust whether they should run up- or downwards (sneak + rightclick).
Rightclicking a conveyor with any dye will colour the walls of the conveyor to easily identify where is is going.<np>
<&conveyor_redstone_recipe>The Redstone Controlled Conveyor Belt can be disabled with a redstone signal.
The panel on its side allows attaching a lever, but a redstone signal may be input from any direction. Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to move the panel to the other side.<np>
<&conveyor_dropper_recipe>The Dropping Conveyor Belt is quite simply a conveyor with a hatch in the middle, allowing it to drop items that pass over it downwards.
Items will be inserted into inventories below or simply dropped if there is an empty space below the conveyor.
The hatch can be shut with a redstone signal, when desired.<np>
<&conveyor_extract_recipe>The Extracting Conveyor Belt possesses the ability to extract items from an inventory in a similar fashion to a Hopper. Unlike the latter however, it possesses no internal inventory and will place extracted items onto the belt.
Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to change its input side. Use the Engineer's Screwdriver to adjust the speed at which it extracts.<np>
<&conveyor_vertical_recipe>The Vertical Conveyor Belt is a belt meant to be mounted on walls. Using the buckets attached to is, it will lift entities straight up. Despite the use of the term "bucket", it will not lift fluids.
This belt can insert into inventories above it or simply expel items over the edge at the top onto more conveyors.<np>
<&conveyor_splitter_recipe>The Splitting Conveyor Belt alternates between redirecting Items and Entities left and right, plain and simple. This feature can be used to achieve a more equal distribution in your factories.<np>
<&conveyor_covered_recipe>The Covered Conveyor Belt works just like a normal conveyor, however it is covered by a piece of scaffolding, which prevents players from picking up items from it.
You can rightclick it with other types of scaffold or glass to change the cover's appearance.<np>
<&conveyor_other_covered_recipes>Similarly, the Dropping, Extracting, Splitting and Vertical Conveyors can also be covered in scaffolding to achieve the same benefits of "pickup-prevention" while still functioning as they normally do.
<&chute_recipes>Chutes are simple constructions made from sheetmetal that allow entities to drop down straight.
They can insert into inventories below them and be inserted into by conveyors or similar devices. Items within them won't be picked up by players and should be immune to most forms of attraction, magnetic or magical.
Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to turn the chute into a corner piece that directs an entity to the side.
传送带
谁还需要铁轨?
<&conveyor_recipes>传送带运输是把附近物品搬回家的便捷途径。虽然它们有足够的动力来运输生物，比如说牛、羊，但它们真正的力量只有在运输物品时才能得到体现.
把物品丢到传送带上即可实现搬运。如果末端是能够接收物品的容器，物品就会被放入到容器里。
像漏斗这样的方块可以把物品输出到传送带上，使用工程师锤可以转动传送带的方向（右击），或是调整为上行或下行（潜行时右击）。
用任何染料右击一个传送带可以将侧壁染色，更容易识别通到哪里。<np>
<&conveyor_redstone_recipe>红石控制传送带可以在红石信号高时停止运行。
在其侧面的面板允许附加一个杠杆，但红石信号可以从任何方向输入。用工程师锤子右键以移动面板到另一边。<np>
<&conveyor_dropper_recipe>掉落传送带就是一个中间开洞的简单传送带，可以使得它将物品下落传输。
物品会装入下方的容器，或者简单地以掉落物形式出现在下方，如果下方的方块不接受。
这个洞可以使用红石信号在需要时关闭。<np>
<&conveyor_extract_recipe>提取传送带拥有像漏斗一样从容器中提取物品的能力。但不像后者，它没有内部容量，会将物品直接放到传送带上。
使用工程师之锤Shift右键可以转动输入方向。使用工程师螺丝刀来调整提取速度。<np>
<&conveyor_vertical_recipe>垂直传送带适用于爬墙运输。使用自带的桶，它可以将实体向上提。虽然是"桶"，但它并不能提升流体。
这个传送带可以输入到上方的方块或仅仅将顶部边缘的物品传送到其它的传送带。<np>
<&conveyor_splitter_recipe>分流传送带可以将物品和实体重定向，简单直白。它可以使你工厂中的物品分配更加均匀。<np>
<&conveyor_covered_recipe>遮蔽传送带就像普通传送带一样，但是有一层脚手架保护，防止玩家从上方取走物品。
你可以用其它的脚手架或玻璃右键来改变外观。<np>
<&conveyor_other_covered_recipes>相似地，掉落、提取、垂直和分流传送带都可以用脚手架遮蔽，达到防止玩家拿取的效果，同时不影响正常工作。
<&chute_recipes>滑道是由薄板制成的简单结构，允许实体沿直线下降。
它们可以输出到下面的方块中，也可以通过传送带或类似的设备输入。里面的物品不会被玩家捡起来，并且会对大多数形式的吸引力免疫，磁性的或者魔法的。
用工程师锤Shift右键可以使它变成转角形式，让物品或实体转向一边。
