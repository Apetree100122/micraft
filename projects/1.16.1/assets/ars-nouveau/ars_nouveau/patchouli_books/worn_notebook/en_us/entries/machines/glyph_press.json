These glyphs can be used to unlock new spells in a spell book or may be used in special crafting recipes. Creating a glyph will require a special form of magical clay, a reagent for the spell, and nearby mana provided by a mana jar. To use the glyph press, first place your clay into the press. "

The glyph press may be automated using Hoppers. A hopper from any side will place Clay, while a hopper from the top can insert the reagent for the clay. If there is enough mana nearby, the crafting will start automatically. If a chest is adjacent to the glyph press, glyphs will be deposited automatically."
