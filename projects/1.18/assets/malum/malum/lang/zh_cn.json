I have been able to use it to break down an impetus, and it stands to reason I could use it to restore one. By using spirit crystals in the Crucible instead of Brilliance in an anvil, I can do more than that - I can restore nearly anything.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_restoration.2": "Every metal and make of tool or armor requires its own set of spirits to repair, and its own repair material. For an促符, the repair material $iis/$ the spirits instead. The repair material must be placed on a Twisted Tablet facing the Crucible. Once the spirits coalesce, the item will be repaired somewhat.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_restoration.3": "It appears that materials in tune with spirit arcana, such as Soulstained Steel or Hallowed Gold, are more efficient in this process. They will be repaired more than their mundane counterparts would for the same cost.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_rite": "The rite - if you could call something so chaotic that - corrupts and burns through the totem, altering its very base nature, and transmuting the world around it into some indeterminate blighted powder.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_rite.description.1": "Raw arcana provides the basis for all rites. Without power, nothing would be accomplished. This naturally makes one wonder what effect raw arcana would have as the focus of a rite. The answer is a complex and dangerous one.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_rite.description.2": "It requires far more to focus than other rites, taking the entire five runes to activate. It's as though I am pushing on some threshold, and need to break through. And in breaking through... momentum is conserved.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_rite.description.3": "And once altered, the wood's color changes, along with its magical disposition. What I dub Soulwood bears scars from the violent method of its creation. Those scars warp magic, altering its fundamental nature. Any spirit rite performed with a Soulwood totem will produce a vastly different effect.",

All of these impurities can be harnessed, and beyond that, I can infuse this power into my magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.2": "Doing this carries the perhaps predictable effect that my own hunger amplifies, draining quicker in the process. And... by eating things which revile me, things which are rotten, this powerful effect is extended beyond it's natural duration. The magic proficiency this grants is immense, but... I must say, the means are rather distasteful.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blazing_quartz.1": "It stands to reason that a place like the nether would have a substance that was flammable, and Blazing Quartz certainly fits the bill. It acts much like coal, even being able to form torches. A useful substance, even if fairly mundane.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.arcane_rite.1": "That echo is why this substance is important for the Unchained Rite. The Rite remembers the violence of its creation, and resonates with the memory within the blight, applying its power to things laying on top of it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.composition.1": "The Undirected Rite, as the name suggests, is random. It transmutes, but it has no pattern to transmute things to. So, instead, you get something random, bits of disparate matter all jumbled together into a foul-smelling powder. I wouldn't recommend eating it, or growing things on it, but it's otherwise harmless.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.intro.1": "Blight. $iSomething which spoils or damages./$ What the Undirected Rite has created has many strange properties, and I intend to categorize them.\nThe na\u0102\u017Bve explanation is that it is simply another form of power that taints the world, but that isn't right. Blight isn't harmful, not inof itself. It's just... $igunk./$",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.spread.1": "Blight does not spread on its own. It's just random matter, after all. But it has a spiritual memory, an echo of how it was created, and, given arcana, will effect that transmutation on nearby substances.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.1": "Brilliance is a term I have heard bandied about for what others call experience. It is a part of the soul, though improperly attached, and can be collected and used for enchanting and repairs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.2": "What many don't know is that it can condense into a physical form. I have heard rumors of solid Brilliance coming from crushing ore, but the most reliable source is small clusters of ore where a soul faded away, leaving its experiences engraved on the stone.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.1": "The Spirit Crucible is, unfortunately, a rather slow device. It takes time for it to coalesce the power of the arcana into the central item. This isn't without reason. Most matter simply can't take a faster stream, and you risk damaging the catalyst by overloading it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.2": "However, by heating the catalyst through mystic means, you can lessen this rejection and speed up the coalescence at once. That is what the Spirit Catalyzer is for. Unfortunately, this is not perfect, and instability often causes the catalyst to be damaged more than strictly necessary.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.3": "Each fueled Catalyzer nearby to a Crucible will amplify the speed of focusing exponentially, up to a maximum of eight.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_arcana.1": "Eldritch arcana is a mystery to me. It has no impulse, none that I can understand, at least. And yet, it doesn't act like raw arcana. It changes, emboldens, enlightens... Raw arcana merely amplifies. This... this alters.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.eldritch_arcana.2": "I am not sure I understand what impulse creates this arcana. I find it in very few beings, and those I find it in are those who already defy explanation. But if it must be the pair to raw arcana, then that would imply that it's the impulse of endings, the $ilast/$ principle of all things.\n\nI do not like that thought.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aerial.1": "Aerial arcana is the simplest of the elemental arcana. That very simplicity that gives it its utility. I have heard tales of magi soaring on the winds, ruling the skies. If any arcana is to make those tales achievable, it is this.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aerial.2": "It is the impulse of speed given form, the desire to run and to soar. It is found in anything particularly swift or mobile.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aqueous.1": "And finally, Aqueous arcana. It is strange, to say the least. It is malleable, yet doesn't do much by itself. It grants an affinity for the sea, but beyond that, its effects are rather esoteric.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.aqueous.2": "It is the impulse of change, the desire to adapt. It is found in anything that embodies that adaptation, as well as anything which lives in the flowing waters.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.elemental_arcana.infernal.2": "It is the impulse of light, the desire to burn. It is found in anything that shines brightly, as well as most denizens of the nether.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.1": "When a being dies, its soul disperses. This is basic theory, and well proven by this point. It's been proposed that sometimes, that power leaks into the body of the creature as it dies, to explain the existence of reagents they drop. That hadn't been proven yet.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.2": "But now, with my scythe, I have proved it beyond doubt. When a soul is shattered, the energy stays in physical form. It happens even without striking the soul, but it's much more likely for it to infuse a bit of that creature when that happens, so far more reagents are produced that way.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.esoteric_reaping.3": "I have discovered four such reagents, which I will detail further in this entry. In summary, the flesh of zombies can curdle to Rotting Essence; the bones of skeletons can crystallize to Grim Talc; the magic of witches can form Alchemical Calx; and the wings of phantoms can spin to Astral Weave.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.1": "A common task for an apprentice magus is to create a flame that burns without heat or fuel. It serves as a test of magical control, as well as the ability to circumvent natural phenomena. Spirit arcana, of course, can produce this wonder as well.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.2": "A peculiarity of Ether's flame is that it resonates with colors. As if it was leather to be dyed, I can tint its appearance. It is an emitter of light, so dyeing it darker colors will lower the intensity rather than change the color of the flame itself.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.1": "As if this was not enough, I have found a way to imbue a second color into my Ether, creating Iridescent Ether. When created, this form of Ether locks in its original color, leaving a new, $isecond/$ color open to dyeing. The light will shift from the original color into the new color towards the peak of the flames.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.2": "Getting the right coloring for this can be tricky, though. As stated, once Ether is made Iridescent, its original color can no longer be changed. This is hardly an issue, but should be kept in mind when tinting your flames.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.etheric_nitrate.1": "It's a throwable bomb. Not much to it, but it looks pretty I guess.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.etheric_nitrate.vivid_nitrate.1": "Vivid nitrate, which lacks a proper texture as of right now, is a devilish creation. It's a much more potent version of etheric nitrate that also bounces every time it explodes.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.focus_metals.1": "By altering the composition of the Alchemical促符 with niter, sulfur, and Rare Earths, it is possible to alter the artifact in such a way that allows for forming nodes of most pure metals.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.focus_metals.2": "It isn't particularly efficient or fast, but it is certainly better than having to mine for every ingot I need. Each metallic node can be processed at a furnace of any kind into two thirds of an ingot worth of metal nuggets.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.3": "The energies this thaumaturgical discipline manipulates seem to be rooted in the soul. More accurately, they are the energies of the soul, the inclinations and impulses that make up each one of us.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.4": "So far, what I have described is basic. But I have found a way to separate, and then condense, the impulse of a soul into a physical form I call a spirit crystal. This forms the basis of my research.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.5": "The natures of the soul I condense influence the crystal's properties. Each soul is slightly different, and that can result in changes to the crystals formed. I believe these spirit crystals to be just the breakthrough I need.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.magebane_belt.1": "By twisting a gilded belt into it's rather sinister alter ego I may create the magebane belt. This alteration exchanges defense for offense, allowing my soul ward shielding to reroute any damage it absorbs back to the inflicter.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_hidden_blade.1": "When the bearer of this necklace is struck, they receive a temporary but incredibly powerful boost to their scythe's damage output proportional to the amount of damage taken. The effect lasts for a single strike.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror.1": "I have devised another way to capture some of the lost energy from loose spirits. The Resonant Lens I socketed in is able to focus magic, collecting a little bit of excess energy as I pick up arcana. This energy is then redistributed to the rest of my trinkets, increasing the effect of any that act upon collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge.1": "The sweep of the scythe is its main draw. The ability to cut my targets like so much wheat is invaluable. But that comes at the cost of damage to a single target. This necklace mystically focuses the edge of my attack, directing all of the power into one target for a strong damage boost.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_tidal_affinity.1": "You are faster in water. While under the effect of conduit power, the effect is further improved. You also amass a strong damage reduction and are blessed with constant health regeneration.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.arcane.1": "While other arcana are impulses of the soul, it would be more accurate to say that the arcane is the impulse of the arcana themselves. This $braw arcana/$ lacks any particular quality, simply being undirected spiritual power.",

The impulses that define you are woven into your very self, after all. But lacking an impulse, perhaps this arcana is different. A witch was not born a mage, after all.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.sacred.1": "Sacred arcana is essential to any magic that enhances life. It can be defined as holy, the energy of particularly vibrant life, or even the simplicity of youth. It is pure and untainted, making it a useful component.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.2": "What I had managed to do before with careful, painstaking experiments, the scythe did in a matter of seconds. The souls of the monsters I slew shattered, streaming bits of deeply hued matter towards me: the spirit crystals. Finally, my research can begin in earnest.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.color.1": "The most obvious differences with the tree itself are shape and leaf color. Soulwood is more spindly than Runewood, and its leaves are a sickly purple hue instead of a rich orange-yellow. It can still be used for many of the same things, though.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.intro.1": "After further study, I have discovered that the Soulwood produced by the Unchained Rite is actually an entirely different species from the Runewood it is made from. It grows differently, it acts differently... it appears the spiritual scars that created it go deeper than just its color and magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.sap.1": "The sticky lifeblood of the tree also seems to well up much more often in a tree than in Runewood. The sap's effects are corrupted as well; rather than restoring my vigor, Unholy Syrup enhances it, increasing my attack strength.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.1": "The soul is a notoriously fickle thing. Even confirming its existence is difficult, requiring the highest thaumaturgies to get a reading. That is what sets spirit arcana apart from other magic. We don't need grand assemblies and esoteric artifice to see a soul. Simply destroying it is proof enough.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.2": "A material I have named Soulstone is the means by which we do so. It appears mundane until refined, but once it is rid of impurities, it seems... out of phase with the world.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.3": "These energies, as previously noted, have different 'frequencies' of sorts. A being burning with light would have a soul that reflects that radiance, and a being prone to adaptation would have a soul as malleable as itself.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.2": "Hallowed Gold, as a metal, acts much like its mundane counterpart. The inherent innocence of the arcana infused into the alloy makes other arcana glide through it smoothly, creating the perfect conductor for my purposes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.spirit_jar.1": "A simple application of this metal is the Spirit Jar. As spirits in their raw form don't have mass, by trapping them under Hallowed Gold you can store far more than you could physically. The capacity of these jars is near-infinite, though each only stores one type of spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.1": "Iron is mundane, in a word. By using Hex Ash as my source of carbon, and attuning the metal with Soulstone, I can create a metal that is $isimultaneously/$ in and out of phase with the world.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.2": "Anything made from Soulstained Steel is capable of striking the soul, without the need for specifics of engineering like with my crude scythe. Wearing the metal in its base form as armor is dangerous, as it will touch your own soul as well, so I must engineer a countermeasure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.tainted_rock.1": "Stone is reluctant to change, but nothing can endure the power of an unchained soul forever. By using raw arcana to force that change, I have created stones with useful magical properties. With Sacred arcana as the catalyst, it forms 污秽石, a stone that dissipates magic nearby.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.twisted_rock.1": "With Wicked arcana's nature as the opposite of Sacred, it follows that the stone produced with it would act opposite. 扭曲石 has most of the same properties as 污秽石, but pushes magic away from it instead of dissipating it. Both can be fashioned into item holders, as Runewood can.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.1": "Many disciplines of magic, and even more mundane practices, allow the creation of useful trinkets. These are also referred to as baubles or curios by some. The metals I have alloyed have properties useful in their own rights, and can be used as the basis for even grander designs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.2": "In their most basic form, Hallowed Gold trinkets protect the user as if they were wearing weak armor, and Soulstained Steel trinkets increase the toughness of the armor being worn.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.guardian_ring.1": "As a first attempt to create a trinket using these as a base, I have designed one that mimics Soulstained Armor's Soul Ward.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.the_device": "even works while bended",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.1": "Up until now, when performing spirit arcana, I have limited my research to personal enhancement and material production. Now, I affect the world. To begin with, I may engrave spirit arcana into Runewood Logs, forming a rune representing the magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.2": "If unwanted, engraved spirits can be stripped off with an axe, but I have uses in mind. With a Runewood Totem Base, and then a specific set of runes in a Runewood Log pillar placed above my totem base, I can perform a Spirit Rite. These rituals soak power into the world around them, changing the beings or blocks in the area.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.3": "While each rite does offer a unique function, they follow patterns and categorize easily. For what I term \"aura rites\", they are simple, effect-providing rites that affect anything living within eight blocks of the base. For other rituals which alter beings, most affect anything within half the range of an aura rite.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.4": "For those which alter blocks, most affect the five-by-five area on the level beneath the base, towards where the runes are facing. These rituals can also be made more selective with the use of Item Stands. By placing them on the sides of the rune pillars, you can make the ritual only recognize and alter the types of blocks lying on the stands.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.5": "One caveat is that no rite's totem may function within the range of another, identical ritual. If you try, the first one will simply fizzle out, the energies coursing through it disrupted.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.transmutation.intro.1": "Besides creating soulwood, the unchained rite can be used to create a variety of blocks. Here are some uhhh, transmutation trees. Start by placing the block at the top, it will step through every block in the shown list before ending up as blight.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.1": "The Tyrving is a rather esoteric blade. It's strange design makes it appear as a weak weapon not suited for combat. However, it's hex ash lining and twisted rock form cause it to deal extra magic damage to the soul, the greater the soul the more benefit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.2": "The weapon can also be repaired using arcane restoration quite efficiently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.voodoo_magic.1": "The future holds many secrets, see you in 1.19.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_rite": "Nearby hostile beings are slowly brought to within an inch of death.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.wicked_rite.greater": "By twisting the power of malice like a knife, nearby beings on the brink of death are dealt a fatal blow, shattering their soul.",
