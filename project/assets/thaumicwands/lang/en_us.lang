# -- Stages --

# Unlock Thaumaturgy
research.UNLOCKTHAUMATURGY.stage.0=While creating a Thaumometer using the Arcane Workbench was relatively easy, it seems like crafting other devices requires, besides raw essentia crystals, vis aswell. However all my efforts to drain it from the aura directly were fruitless, maybe I need some kind of channeling device.
research.UNLOCKTHAUMATURGY.stage.1=Even though I can not rely on using vis for creating my channeling device, I came up with quite elegant, to cast smaller quantities of vis. This rather crude wand is capable of storing 50 vis inside of it, now I just need to fill it with some vis.

# Base Thaumaturgy
research.BASETHAUMATURGY.stage.0=Now that I have my Wand I can begin assembling arcane devices, but I doubt that this Wand will be enough maybe I should begin looking at other Materials.
research.BASETHAUMATURGY.addendum.0=I realized that those foci I made do not only fit a top of the Casters Gaunlet, but also dircetly at the tip of my wand. Interstingly the foci started to drain the vis and not from the surrounding aura but from my wand, this might be come in handy.

# Copper Caps
research.CAP_COPPER.stage.0=Those Engineers use this metal to build their silly machines and conduct something they call flux (these fools have no idea what they are talking about), hopefully it is able to conduct vis aswell.
research.CAP_COPPER.stage.1=If the Engineers knew what they've got at hand there...<BR> This metal, though not better at channeling vis that iron, has a even more interesting property regarding vis crystals. It seems that the vis emitted from this metall is somehow tinted with §7ORDO§r and §8PERDITIO§r, resulting in a decreased amount of vis crystals of these types. 

# Brass Caps
research.CAP_BRASS.stage.0=This new metal I created seems to conduct vis better than regular iron, so what if I capped of my wand with some alchemical brass.
research.CAP_BRASS.stage.1=My newly made brass wand caps conduct vis far better than mundane iron does, resulting in a vis discount of 5% 

# Silver Caps
research.CAP_SILVER.stage.0=Silver is a metal that is mostly used by Engineers, but it there are also some people that specialize in witchcraft who use it to protect themselves of werewolfs, so maybe there is more to it.
research.CAP_SILVER.stage.1=The witches were right, silver is an incredible vis conductor, but I doubt that they know how to make it show it's full potential, it took me an arcane infusion to make the silver work as a decent vis conductor, but it was worth it. In regards to vis discount it is not really better than brass, but it has a crystal discount on all of 4 elemental aspects, which is great.

# Thaumium Caps
research.CAP_THAUMIUM.stage.0=How could I not think of this, thaumium is a incredibly magical metal, so making caps out of it is only logical, but I have a feeling that this will prove as a harder task than all the others.
research.CAP_THAUMIUM.stage.1=I was able to constrcut quite nice wand caps out of thaumium. The base design was the same as always, but they did not work as well as I hoped, but after I infused these caps with some essentia and salis mundus, the caps had a much larger affinity for vis, making them better than brass. These caps give a 10 % on all crafts, which is quite decent.

# Void Caps
research.CAP_VOID.stage.0=I've seen things. This metal, it is strong, it is powerful, it is resisting any vis that flows through it, but there must be a way, there MUST...
research.CAP_VOID.stage.1=It works, it actually works. By infusing these caps with dark types of essentia I was able to create caps than conduct vis like nothing I've ever seen before, resulting in a discount of 20 %, but at what cost ?

# Greatwood Rod
research.ROD_GREATWOOD.0=On my journeys I came across a tree that is somehow different, my Wand is already made of wood, but this wood feels more magical, I probably should try to craft a new wand rod out of it.
research.ROD_GREATWOOD.1=Greatwood is actually great, it took a little vis and some §8Perditio§r Crystals, but I was able to turn it into a new wand rod, that is a lot better than plain wood. It allowes one to store 200 vis, which allows whole new posiibilities, but I have seen some other trees lately.

# Reed Rod
research.ROD_REED.0=I had an idea, what about sugarcane, it react naturally to §e aer§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_REED.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the sugarcane to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace if I hold it high enough, I wonder what happens if it gets high enough.

# Blaze Rod
research.ROD_BLAZE.0=I had an idea, what about blaze rod, it react naturally to §6ignis§r and it has a fitting shape, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_BLAZE.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the blaze rod to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near to my furnace, I wonder what happens if it gets hot enough.

# Ice Rod
research.ROD_ICE.0=I had an idea, what about ice, it react naturally to §9aqua§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_ICE.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the ice to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near to snow, I wonder what happens if it gets cold enough.

# Obsidian Rod
research.ROD_OBSIDIAN.0=I had an idea, what about obsidian, it react naturally to §2terra§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_OBSIDIAN.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the obsidain to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near the ground, I wonder what happens if it get low enough.

# Quartz Rod
research.ROD_QUARTZ.0=I had an idea, what about quartz, it react naturally to §fordo§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_QUARTZ.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the quartz to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood.

# Bone Rod
research.ROD_BONE.0=I had an idea, what about bone, it react naturally to §8perditio§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, how could I think this is a good idea.
research.ROD_BONE.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the bone to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood.

#Silverwood ROD
research.ROD_SILVERWOOD.0=The Wood of this tree seems to hold a much higher magical potential than all other plants I have seen so far, perfect for a sizable wand core, my ambition is high, and so will be the effort I will put into it.
research.ROD_SILVERWOOD.1=I've done it, even though this wood had a lot of potential I was able to increase the amount of storable vis even further, it took quite a bit of essentia, but I am sure that 800 vis should be enough for now.
